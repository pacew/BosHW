	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

      <a href='#'>How did Colonial laws help create today's Harborwalk?

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p>
	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

      <a href='#'>Why does the Custom House look so different?
	<span class='smaller'>[expand]</span>
      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> In 1915, the Custom House tower was added to the domed
	building visible on the 1848 panorama. It was the first
	skyscraper built in Boston and remained the only one until the
	old John Hancock building was completed in 1949. As a federal
	building, the Custom House tower didn't have to adhere to
	Boston building height restrictions, which were 125 feet. The
	tower is 495 feet high.
      </p>

      <p>
	The first two floors of the Custom House are open to the
	public. Another hidden gem is the observation deck on the 26th
	floor, open to the public 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Saturday through
	Thursday for fabulous 360-degree views of the city and
	harbor. The same pair of peregrine falcons return annually to
	nest on the 30th floor. You can watch their chicks grow on a
	Mass Audubon camcorder.

      <a href='#'>Where is the Perkins School for the Blind now?
	<span class='smaller'>[expand]</span>
      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> The Perkins School for the Blind, originally known as the
	New England Asylum for the Blind, was the first school for the
	blind in the United States. It opened its doors to students in
	1832. A year later, it moved to a house on Pearl Street
	donated by Thomas H. Perkins. With an ever-expanding student
	population, by the late 1830s, the school needed a new
	home. With permission from Mr. Perkins to sell his house, the
	school purchased what had been the Washington Hotel on
	Dorchester Heights in South Boston&mdash;the building you see on the
	panorama&mdash;and moved there in 1839. At this time, the school
	took on the Perkins name, in gratitude for his support. For
	more than 70 years, despite various challenges, the school
	remained in South Boston. In 1912, Perkins School for the
	Blind moved to its present campus along the Charles River in
	Watertown. </p>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> In 1840, Boston officials convinced Samuel Cunard to make
	this city the U.S. terminus for his new transatlantic mail
	service. The East Boston Company persuaded Cunard to dock in
	East Boston by offering the company free docking.
