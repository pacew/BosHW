	    <h2>BOSTON'S WOODEN SHIPBUILDING CENTER</h2>
	    <p>
	      In 1839, just six years after East Boston began to be
	      developed as a neighborhood, Samuel Hall established
	      a shipyard on this site. It grew to include dry docks that
	      used the most advanced steam-powered technology
	      and marine railways, represented in the pavement
	      behind you. Among the 110 vessels Hall built here was
	      Boston’s first clipper ship—Surprise. Her launch in 1850
	      was accompanied by church bells ringing. The names
	      of some of Hall’s other vessels are engraved on the
	      granite paving.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Hall’s shipyard was one of several along the stretch
	      of the waterfront from here north to the Meridian Street
	      Bridge, where Hall, Donald McKay, Robert Jackson, Paul
	      Curtis, and others built world-famous ships. Spurred by
	      the California Gold Rush and a demand for faster ships,
	      they launched more than 200 vessels in 20 years.

	      Together with the Charlestown Navy Yard across the
	      harbor and shipyards in South Boston, East Boston
	      shipbuilders made the city one of the premier ship
	      building centers in the country during the mid 1800s.
	      TOP  Samuel H. Pook was 23 when he
	      designed Surprise, the first of several of his
	      very fast clipper ships, and one of the most
	      successful clippers in the China trade. Pook
	      later became a naval architect for the
	      U.S. Navy.

	    Sailing cards like this one
	    for Fearless were widely used to advertise
	    ship departures. Fearless, also designed by
	    Pook, was built here by George Sampson,
	    who leased part of Hall’s shipyard starting
	    in 1852.

	  <p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s mother, Sara
	    Delano, turned eight on the Surprise, en route to Hong
	    Kong with her mother and six siblings.  They joined Warren
	    Delano, who was very active in the China trade for many
	    years.  FDR admired his family’s maritime history and
	    owned two paintings and this model of the famous clipper
	    ship, as well as the ship’s log of his mother’s trip.</p>
