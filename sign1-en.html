	  <h2>BOSTON'S WOODEN SHIPBUILDING CENTER</h2>
	  <p>
	    In 1839, just six years after East Boston began to be
	    developed as a neighborhood, Samuel Hall established a
	    shipyard on this site. It grew to include dry docks that
	    used the most advanced steam-powered technology and marine
	    railways, still visible today along the waterfront.  Among
	    the 110 vessels Hall built here was Boston’s first clipper
	    ship—<em>Surprise</em>. Her launch in 1850 was accompanied
	    by church bells ringing. The names of some of Hall’s other
	    vessels are engraved on the granite paving.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Hall’s shipyard was one of several along the stretch
	    of the waterfront from here north to the Meridian Street
	    Bridge, where Hall, Donald McKay, Robert Jackson, Paul
	    Curtis, and others built world-famous ships. Spurred by
	    the California Gold Rush and a demand for faster ships,
	    they launched more than 200 vessels in 20 years.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Together with the Charlestown Navy Yard across the
	    harbor and shipyards in South Boston, East Boston
	    shipbuilders made the city one of the premier ship
	    building centers in the country during the mid 1800s.

	      Sailing cards like this one
	      for <em>Fearless</em> were widely used to advertise
	      ship departures. <em>Fearless</em>, also designed by
	      Pook, was built here by George Sampson,
	      who leased part of Hall’s shipyard starting
	      in 1852.

	    <p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s mother, Sara
	      Delano, turned eight on the <em>Surprise</em>, en route to Hong
	      Kong with her mother and six siblings.  They joined Warren
	      Delano, who was very active in the China trade for many
	      years.  FDR admired his family’s maritime history and
	      owned two paintings and this model of the famous clipper
	      ship, as well as the ship’s log of his mother’s trip.</p>

	    Swift, with long sharp bows and names like <em>Chariot of Fame</em>,
	    <em>Empress of the Seas</em>, 
	    <em>Flying Fish</em>, 
	    <em>Coeur de Lion</em>, 
	    <em>Staghound</em>, and <em>Lightning</em>, “in every way
	    clipper ships ranked among the most handsome vessels ever
	    put afloat.” [1] Three-masted and square-rigged, clipper
	    ships were unusual merchant vessels because they were
	    designed for great speed rather than capacity. They sailed
	    across oceans on trade routes where speed translated into
	    significant profit. In the China trade, an exceptionally
	    fast clipper ship could beat the competition, bringing
	    back tea from Guangzhou (formerly Canton to westerners)
	    and fetching the highest prices. The California Gold Rush
	    (1848–1855) and the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s
	    spurred additional clipper ship construction.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Clipper ships set records: <em>Flying Cloud</em>—New York
	    to San Francisco in 89 days, 8 hours; <em>Sovereign of the
	    Seas</em> 22 knots;
	    <em>Champion of the Seas</em> 465 nautical miles in one
	    day. No steamship of their day could beat them. And no
	    square-rigged ship has ever broken <em>Flying Cloud’s</em>
	    record. Finally in the 1870s, with improved marine engines
	    and boilers, steam-powered vessels broke clipper ship
	    speed records. [2] And so like the gold rushes themselves,
	    the era of clipper ships was short-lived. Because the
	    vessels carried such immense sail area, they required
	    large crews, which added to operating costs. And the
	    opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 favored steamships. For
	    many, clipper ships represent the zenith of the age of
	    sail.  Their memory endures in books, paintings, and
	    models.

	    Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New
	    state regulations. The combination created the 43-mile
	    Boston Harborwalk—a public path, stretching from Logan
	    Airport through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset
	    River. In 1978,
	    the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	    Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to
	    improve public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by
	    integrating early Colonial laws into new state
	    regulations.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In the decades that followed, community activists, city
	    and state government, and developers of shoreline projects
	    have worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always
	    constructed along the waterfront. Some sites also provide
	    public amenities—bathrooms, meeting places, kayak
	    launches, etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming
	    residents and visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	  <a href='#'>What were the Colonial laws?

	  </a>
	</h2>

	<div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
	  <p>
	    Early Colonial laws established public right of access
	    along tidelands to protect citizens’ rights to fish, hunt,
	    and navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws
	    go back even further: They stem from Roman law, which was
	    incorporated into English law and brought over to
	    Massachusetts by English settlers. Then, in the 1640s,
	    Massachusetts Bay Colony passed laws permitting private
	    docks in the intertidal area (between low and high tide)
	    as long as public access was retained. Almost all of
	    Boston’s waterfront is filled land that was once the
	    intertidal area. This, together with the centuries-old
	    legal right of access, served as the underpinnings for the
	    1978 CZM regulations.

      <p><strong>The Friends of the Boston Harborwalk</strong> is a
      group of volunteers, affiliated with Boston Harbor Now,
      dedicated to enhancing enjoyment of Boston’s 43-mile
      Harborwalk. The Friends meet monthly to plan and coordinate our
      three main priorities. </p>
      <p>1. Host monthly two-hour long tours connected to the
	Harborwalk or Boston Harbor;</p>
      <p>2. Facilitate waterfront clean-up days to ensure that the
	full length of the Harborwalk is clean, safe, and inviting;</p>
      <p>3. Create engaging interpretive signs to help people learn
	about and enjoy the rich stories connected to Boston’s
	waterfront.</p>
