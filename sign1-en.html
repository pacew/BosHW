	    <h2>BOSTON'S WOODEN SHIPBUILDING CENTER</h2>
	    <p>
	      In 1839, just six years after East Boston began to be
	      developed as a neighborhood, Samuel Hall established
	      a shipyard on this site. It grew to include dry docks that
	      used the most advanced steam-powered technology
	      and marine railways, represented in the pavement
	      behind you. Among the 110 vessels Hall built here was
	      Boston’s first clipper ship—Surprise. Her launch in 1850
	      was accompanied by church bells ringing. The names
	      of some of Hall’s other vessels are engraved on the
	      granite paving.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Hall’s shipyard was one of several along the stretch
	      of the waterfront from here north to the Meridian Street
	      Bridge, where Hall, Donald McKay, Robert Jackson, Paul
	      Curtis, and others built world-famous ships. Spurred by
	      the California Gold Rush and a demand for faster ships,
	      they launched more than 200 vessels in 20 years.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Together with the Charlestown Navy Yard across the
	      harbor and shipyards in South Boston, East Boston
	      shipbuilders made the city one of the premier ship
	      building centers in the country during the mid 1800s.

	      Sailing cards like this one
	      for Fearless were widely used to advertise
	      ship departures. Fearless, also designed by
	      Pook, was built here by George Sampson,
	      who leased part of Hall’s shipyard starting
	      in 1852.

	    <p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s mother, Sara
	      Delano, turned eight on the Surprise, en route to Hong
	      Kong with her mother and six siblings.  They joined Warren
	      Delano, who was very active in the China trade for many
	      years.  FDR admired his family’s maritime history and
	      owned two paintings and this model of the famous clipper
	      ship, as well as the ship’s log of his mother’s trip.</p>

      <h2>Did you know?</h2>

      <h2>What’s a clipper ship?</h2>

      <p>
	Swift, with long sharp bows and names like Chariot of Fame,
	Empress of the Seas, Flying Fish, Coeur de Lion, Staghound,
	and Lightning, “in every way clipper ships ranked among the
	most handsome vessels ever put
	afloat.” [1] Three-masted and
	square-rigged, clipper ships were unusual merchant vessels
	because they were designed for great speed rather than
	capacity. They sailed across oceans on trade routes where
	speed translated into significant profit. In the China trade,
	an exceptionally fast clipper ship could beat the competition,
	bringing back tea from Guangzhou (formerly Canton to
	westerners) and fetching the highest prices. The California
	Gold Rush (1848–1855) and the Australian gold rushes of the
	1850s spurred additional clipper ship construction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Clipper ships set records: Flying Cloud—New York to San
	Francisco in 89 days, 8 hours; Sovereign of the Seas 22 knots;
	Champion of the Seas 465 nautical miles in one day. No
	steamship of their day could beat them. And no square-rigged
	ship has ever broken Flying Cloud’s record. Finally in the
	1870s, with improved marine engines and boilers, steam-powered
	vessels broke clipper ship speed records. [2] And so like the
	gold rushes themselves, the era of clipper ships was
	short-lived. Because the vessels carried such immense sail
	area, they required large crews, which added to operating
	costs. And the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 favored
	steamships. For many, clipper ships represent the zenith of
	the age of sail.  Their memory endures in books, paintings,
	and models.
