      <h1>PROLIFIC INVENTOR: OTIS TUFTS</h1>
      <p>
	Otis Tufts built the first iron-hulled vessel in the United
	States on this wharf in 1854.  Named the R.B. Forbes, after
	its owner Robert Bennet Forbes, it was often used to tow
	clipper ships built along Border Street to their owners in New
	York. During the Civil War, the tugboat served in the Union
	blockade of Confederate ports until a gale sank it off
	Virginia in 1862.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Cambridge-born Tufts was a remarkable inventor, machinist,
	and pioneer in steam-powered technology, which he applied to
	printing, marble cutting, and sugarcane refining. On seeing
	men building the Boston Custom House driving piles by hand
	(c. 1840), he returned the next day with drawings for a
	steam-driven pile driver that revolutionized
	construction. 
      </p>

      <p>
	And in 1859, Tufts invented the first passenger
	elevator. Previously elevators were used only for freight. His
	"vertical railway elevator," as he called it, rose slowly
	along a solid iron screw. Installed at the Fifth Avenue Hotel
	in New York City, the novelty drew hundreds of visitors
	daily.

	  Simplified drawing of a double-hulled iron ship submitted to
	  U.S. Patent Office by Otis Tufts, 1855. The <em>R. B. Forbes</em>
	  "two skinned" hull, trussed and braced throughout, was built

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

	It appears that Otis Tufts' shop was an incubator for
	talent. Several of his employees went on to establish two of
	the most successful enterprises in the city. In 1853, Abishai
	Miller and other machinists from Tufts' machine shop founded
	the Atlantic Works to produce boilers and marine engines for
	the new steamships beginning to be built. In 1869 Atlantic
	Works moved to Border Street and expanded its business. By
	1922, it was the largest private ship repair facility in
	Boston.</p>

      <p>
	Also in 1853, James Simpson, a mechanic at Otis Tufts'
	company, purchased a site on Marginal Street and began to
	construct a wooden dry dock. In 1854, he received a patent for
	his dry docks and added a second timber dry docks the
	following year. Simpson became famous for his timber dry
	docks, later building docks for the U.S. Navy and the
	government of Newfoundland, among others.

	In April 1851, a fierce storm destroyed the first lighthouse
	on Minot's Ledge, off Situate, just two years after it was
	built. Mariners had come to rely on the lighthouse to warn
	them off the treacherous ledge. Worried that captains might
	mistake the lack of light for safety, Boston authorities
	dispatched the reliable tug&mdash;R. B. Forbes&mdash;equipped with
	temporary lighting apparatus to anchor off Minot's Ledge. The
	tug's life as a lightship was short-lived, however. Another
	storm just a few days later forced it to return to the
	harbor. In 1855, construction on a stone lighthouse began. It
	was lit five years later.
