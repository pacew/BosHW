      <h1>Transformed Land</h1>
      <p>
	The First People lived in this region for thousands of
	years. Their descendants, the Massachusett, named what we now
	call Charlestown, <em>Mishawum</em>&mdash;"Great Springs."  They gathered
	here and at other harbor locations seasonally, to farm and
	hunt for food.
      </p>
      <p>
	The English purchased <em>Mishawum</em> from the principle sac'hem, the
	"Queen of the Massachusett." They renamed the peninsula and
	built homes around City Square. This part of Charlestown
	remained as farm land until 1801, when the federal government
	bought it to establish the Charlestown Navy Yard.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Navy soon filled mudflats and marsh, making land for
	wharves and ship building. In the 1830s, seawalls were
	constructed along the outer edges of the mudflats. This marked
	the end of made land in this section of the Navy Yard; the
	seawall remains in place today, to your right.
      </p>
      <p>
	The land, however, would undergo yet another transformation
	after the Navy Yard closed in 1974. In the decades since,
	housing has sprung up along the waterfront, where the
	Massachusett people once fished, harvested shellfish, and
	launched canoes.

	  July 17, 1605: "We anchored near an island where we observed
	  many smokes along the shore.... There is a great deal of
	  land cleared up and planted with Indian corn.  The country
	  is very pleasant and agreeable, and there is no lack of fine
	  trees.  The canoes of those who live there are made of a
	  single piece, and are very liable to turn over if one is not
	  skillful in managing them."  <span class='smaller'><em>From</em> The Journal of Samuel de
	  Champlain, 1604-1608.  <em>De Champlain is believed to have

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

	Oral tradition, archaeological evidence, and early explorers'
	writing provide evidence that the confederation of indigenous
	Massachusett lived and thrived for centuries in what is now
	called the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the Boston
	Harbor watershed. Led by their sac'hems, they built homes,
	practiced their religion, raised families and prospered. They
	worked their quarries, created tools, and sculpted
	weapons. Several examples of small, temporary camps, dating
	back 2,000&mdash;3,000 years have been found near the mouth of the
	Charles River. Along the coast and on offshore islands, Native
	people planted crops, hunted, and fished. Shell middens
	discovered on Boston's inner harbor islands point to intense
	shellfish collecting and processing. The outer harbor islands
	were used for fishing and seabird hunting.

      <p>Wood working tools, such as these found in Hull, were essential to make dugout canoes. The Massachusett made drills by carefully chipping away the stone to create a pointed, sharp-edged tool. The adze, celt, and gouge were all made by grinding and polishing the stone into the desired shape.</p>

	In the early 1600s, Massachusett tribes living in coastal
	villages had increasing contact with European fishermen and
	traders. With that came exposure to diseases to which they had
	little immunity. Thousands died as a result of epidemics
	between 1616 and 1619.  Massachusett Medicine Sac'hem Ren
	Green writes: "Societies were disrupted, trade threatened, and
	defenses against rival tribes to the north were reduced due to
	the loss of large numbers of warriors. It was a time of great
	grief among the Massachusett people." 
      </p>
      <p>
	In 1630, in what is now Charlestown, a Massachusett band lived
	in a small village in <em>wetus</em>&mdash;summer huts built and owned by the
	tribe's women. The village also included an English-style
	thatched house, presumably from an early English settler.  The
	Massachusett were led by a woman called the "Queen of
	Massachusett." Her real name was not recorded by the English,
	who purchased a large part of Charlestown from her for 36
	shillings.  It is possible that she considered the payment as
	"tribute," giving the English consent to occupy the land. The
	sale of land, explains Ms. Green, "was an unheard-of concept
	for the indigenous Massachusett."

	Tragically, her true name was not recorded; the English called
	her Squaw Sac’hem or Queen of the Massachusett. After her
	husband Grand Sac’hem Nanapashemet was killed in 1619, she was
	chosen as the leader of the Northern Massachusett, whose
	territory stretched from the Piscataqua River (in Portmouth,
	NH) to the Charles River. She served as sac’hem until her sons
	came of age. She signed deeds and other legal records on
	behalf of her people with a stylized bow and arrow.  Brona
	Simon writes in <em>Highway to the Past</em>, that though Squaw Sac’hem
	sold a large part of what is now Charlestown to the English,
	she managed to hold onto much of her people’s remaining
	territory longer than most of her contemporary male
	sac’hems. She appears to have been respected by the English
	officials, who responded favorably to her petitions and
	complaints. She was one of the last Native people to submit to
	conversion to English Protestant religion, and in her later
	years, moved to the Christian Indian town of Natick.

	In the 1600s, colonists gradually encroached on territories
	that had been under the control of various Indian tribes for
	millenia. The newcomers brought with them diseases (smallpox,
	measles, typhoid) that continued to decimate Native
	populations. These and other factors exacerbated tensions.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Pequot War (1636-38) and King’s Philip’s War (1675-78)
	were the result of the deep dislocation felt by many. Both
	wars were costly to colonists and Indian tribes, but
	especially so to the latter. Thousands died in battle or from
	injuries, sickness, or starvation. Hundreds were enslaved and
	sold to sugar plantation owners in the Caribbean, where they
	labored under brutal conditions. Some joined other tribes as
	captives or tribal members. Others fled west and north. A few
	returned or moved to the handful of remaining Christian Indian
	Towns in the area, like Natick and Ponkapoag (now Canton). The
	social cohesiveness of entire groups of indigenous people was
	in peril.

	Scholar Neal Salisbury writes that between 1800 and 1945,
	small, often “impoverished communities of Indians struggled to
	retain their identities and traditions in the face of an
	American society with very different cultural priorities.”
	[p. 51] Despite enormous pressures, groups of Massachusett,
	Mashpee, Narraganset, Mohegan, Nipmuc, and other people
	managed to sustain distinctive features of their Native
	American identities into the 20th century and beyond. The
	history of New England Indians, Salisbury writes, is “marked
	by enormous upheavals and tragedy, but it also reveals
	underlying elements of continuity and triumph. For, however
	transformed, today’s Indians are the biological, cultural, and
	political descendants of peoples who began settling the region
	12,000 years ago.” [p. 60]

	To ensure the authenticity of his mural, Joshua Winer worked
	closely with the contemporary Native American community, as
	well as Cambridge artist Ross Miller. Mr. Winer invited
	members of the Massachusett Ponkapoag tribe to pose for the
	portraits in his studio in Westwood MA. The plantings in the
	middle of the female figure group are corn, beans, and
	squash—“the Three Sisters.”
      </p>

      <p>
	Mr. Winer’s original mural is one of two sited opposite each
	other on the walls of the Brooks Street underpass, in Brighton
	MA. The 18-foot high and 44-foot long mural was painted in
	2003, as part of a neighborhood beautification initiative
	sponsored by Alston Brighton Community Development. While the
	mural depicts members of the Massachusett tribe working along
	the Charles River in Watertown, the seasonal villages there as
	well as the fishing and farming activities would have been the
	same as in villages closer to the mouth of the river and along
	Boston Harbor.
      </p>

      <p>
	Ross Miller, with whom Mr. Winer collaborated, creates an
	annual work of public art on Boston Common in which
	participants build a fish weir together as a way to
	commemorate the weirs Native people once built to trap alewife
	in the Charles River basin. Evidence of those fish weirs,
	dating back more than 5,000 years, were discovered during
	20th-century excavation work on Boylston Street.
