      <h1>Trade by Sea</h1>
      <p>
	Independence freed Americans from restrictive British
	Navigation Acts, and Boston merchants leaped at the
	opportunity to trade with any country in the world. Soon their
	ships were sailing for the Mediterranean, Russia, South
	America, and the Far East.
	</p>

      <p>
	Starting in the late 1700s, Bostonians made fortunes in the
	China Trade, including Thomas H. Perkins, George Lyman, and
	Thomas Wigglesworth, who had their offices on India
	Wharf. They imported thousands of pounds of tea as well as
	silk and porcelain. In exchange, they initially traded sea
	otter and seal furs obtained from Native people in the
	Northwest, and later sandalwood from Pacific islands. These
	natural resources were quickly decimated. Most U.S. merchants
	then switched to opium from Turkey and India as their
	principal trade product&mdash;despite Chinese laws prohibiting its
	importation.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the 1860s, Boston's sea trade began to shift away from the
	downtown wharves to other areas of the harbor. However, for
	decades India Wharf continued to be busy as regularly
	scheduled steamships operated from here to Portland, Maine,
	and New York City, until all commercial activity ended in the
	1950s.

	  The Columbia-Rediviva, sailing out of Boston, was the first
	  vessel bearing a U.S. flag to circumnavigate the world
	  (1787-1790). Her crew launched the early U.S. trade of sea
	  otter fur for Chinese products.

	  In the second half of the 19th century, steamship sheds were
	  built along the edge of India Wharf for easy loading. The
	  Metropolitan Steamship Company (founded in 1866) and
	  Portland Steam Packet Company operated from India Wharf
	  until they were consolidated in the early 1900s into what
	  became the Eastern Steamship Lines.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Very early U.S. trade with China did not include opium. But
	U.S. (and European) increasing demand for Chinese tea, silks,
	porcelain, and decorative goods wasn't matched by growth in
	Chinese demand for Western exports.<sup>1</sup> Americans did
	ship cotton, woolen goods, furs, clocks, and other mechanical
	curiosities, but the quantities were no match for Chinese
	imports. They didn't want to pay in silver, and so they
	followed in British footsteps and turned to smuggling
	opium. Heard company agent, Bostonian George Dixwell wrote to
	his boss in the mid 1840s: "Opium is cash in transactions [for
	Chinese products] and people who have no opium to trade will
	find it extremely difficult to do anything here [in China]."<sup>2</sup>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> The British brought opium to China from India, but they
	barred U.S. access to that source until 1838. So beginning in
	1804 Americans established sources in Turkey. Boston's Thomas
	Handasyd Perkins began shipping Turkish opium to China a
	decade later. After 1838, American merchants switched to
	Indian opium, which was considered of higher quality.

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> 1729 &mdash; The Chinese emperor banned the sale of opium, but not
	its importation because the drug was still permitted for
	medicinal use.
      </p>
      <p>
	1799 &mdash; As the use of opium climbed, an imperial edict forbade
	foreigners from bringing opium into China, calling it "foreign
	mud." The edict also forbade domestic production.
	</p>
      <p>
	1813 &mdash; With the crisis deepening and addiction having
	devastating effects on Chinese population of all classes, the
	emperor banned opium smoking. The outflow of silver to pay for
	smuggled opium was also damaging the economy.
	</p>
      <p>
	1838 &mdash; The Chinese emperor cracked down further, appointing
	highly respected Lin Zexu as imperial commissioner to end
	opium smuggling.

      <a href='#'>What were the Opium Wars?
	<span class='smaller'>[expand]</span>
      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Long-standing tensions over access to Chinese markets and
	China's insistence that foreigners abide by China's legal
	system intersected with Western traders' insistence on
	smuggling ever-increasing quantities of opium into China. In
	1839, Chinese imperial commissioner Lin Zexu forced foreigners
	to surrender 20,000+ chests of opium (between 2.5 and 3.2
	million pounds), which he then destroyed. The British, owners
	of most of the confiscated opium, were furious and dispatched
	a fleet to obtain "satisfaction and reparation," for their
	merchandise and their pride. British naval might and
	state-of-the-art weaponry crushed Chinese defenses. The
	resulting Nanjing Treaty deeply humiliated the Chinese,
	forcing them to open additional ports for trade and ceding
	Hong Kong.
      </p>
      <p>
	Though the U.S. did not participate in the hostilities,
	merchants pressed the government to negotiate similar trading
	terms. The 1844 Treaty of Wangxia between the U.S. and China
	did just that. It effectively ended the Old China Trade with
	its many restrictions. Interestingly, the Treaty of Wangxia
	specified that any American smuggling opium would be subject
	to Chinese law, but even that concession to Chinese
	sovereignty had no teeth. Opium flowed into China in every
	increasing quantities, mainly on British vessels, but American
	companies with deep Boston connections like Russell & Co and
	Augustine Heard & Co. participated as well. The Chinese dared
	not put up a fight, and in an 1860 treaty finally legalized
	and taxed opium imports. U.S. involvement diminished a lot
	after the trade was legalized and by 1880, U.S. merchants
	exited the opium trade entirely.

      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Boston merchants who smuggled opium into China as part of
	the China Trade made fortunes. Like virtually all drug
	smugglers do. Their wealth made a difference in Boston and
	beyond. They invested their money into railroads, real estate,
	banks, mining, textile mills and insurance companies. In
	short, their capital helped transform the U.S. into an
	industrial power. Several also became philanthropic. For
	example, Thomas Perkins was an early supporter of the Boston
	Athenaeum, and the Perkins School for the Blind carries his
	name thanks to his generosity. How does one balance good works
	like these with the staggering damage done acquiring this
	wealth?
      </p>
      <p>
	In addition, the legacy of opium smuggling&mdash;the Opium Wars and
	the unequal treaties that resulted&mdash;lingers on in China. Many
	Chinese recognize this history as an egregious example of
	Western imperialism and disregard for their country's
	sovereignty. By contrast, few Americans have ever heard of the
	Opium Wars.
