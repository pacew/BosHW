      <h2>SHIP REPAIR</h2>
      <p>
	State-of-the-art shipyard facilities on this site provided
	repair and maintenance services from 1854 to about 1950. By
	1858, Samuel Hall’s East Boston Dry Dock Company included a
	steam-powered floating dry dock capable of lifting 500-ton
	ships. Its 600-foot-long marine railway had a cradle with an
	unprecedented capacity of 1000 tons. Railways with capacities
	of 1500, 2000, and 2500 tons were built later—all by Crandall
	Dry Dock Engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
	In front of you are remnants of the marine railways built in
	1890 and 1892. A vessel in need of repair was floated over a
	timber cradle, which rested on cast-iron rollers on top of the
	tracks. Once secured, the vessel was hauled up the rails above
	the tidal zone.
      </p>
      <p>
	Innovative design and simplicity of operation with minimum
	manpower contributed to the shipyard’s success. Industrial era
	improvements such as wrought iron chains and steam-powered
	winches had replaced ropes, men, and horses. Despite economic
	downturns, a devastating waterfront fire in 1861, and the
	decline in local shipbuilding, ship repair thrived here and
	along Marginal Street.

	  East Boston Dry Dock Company was incorporated in 1847 and
	  sold to Atlantic Works in 1902. The stock certificate may
	  show a sectional dry dock patented and constructed by
	  Phineas Burgess.

	  Crandall Dry Dock Engineers' premier diver, George
	  Landrigan, helped build, inspect, and maintain underwater
	  segments of the marine railways. He also assisted with the
	  docking of vessels. He is shown here with his tender, who
	  directed Landrigan's movements and monitored his
	  safety.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.
