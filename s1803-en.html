      <h1>SHIP REPAIR</h1>
      <p>
	State-of-the-art shipyard facilities on this site provided
	repair and maintenance services from 1854 to about 1950. By
	1858, Samuel Hall's East Boston Dry Dock Company included a
	steam-powered floating dry dock capable of lifting 500-ton
	ships. Its 600-foot-long marine railway had a cradle with an
	unprecedented capacity of 1000 tons. Railways with capacities
	of 1500, 2000, and 2500 tons were built later&ndash;all by Crandall
	Dry Dock Engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
	In front of you are remnants of the marine railways built in
	1890 and 1892. A vessel in need of repair was floated over a
	timber cradle, which rested on cast-iron rollers on top of the
	tracks. Once secured, the vessel was hauled up the rails above
	the tidal zone.
      </p>
      <p>
	Innovative design and simplicity of operation with minimum
	manpower contributed to the shipyard's success. Industrial era
	improvements such as wrought iron chains and steam-powered
	winches had replaced ropes, men, and horses. Despite economic
	downturns, a devastating waterfront fire in 1861, and the
	decline in local shipbuilding, ship repair thrived here and
	along Marginal Street.

	  Crandall Dry Dock Engineers' premier diver, George
	  Landrigan, helped build, inspect, and maintain underwater
	  segments of the marine railways. He also assisted with the
	  docking of vessels. He is shown here with his tender, who
	  directed Landrigan's movements and monitored his
	  safety.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

      <p> Over the course of 150 years, under five generations of Crandalls, the company rose to national and international prominence in the marine railways industry. Crandall Dry Dock Engineers (whose name changed though it always included “Crandall”) has built more than 250 marine railways in the United States, Canada, & abroad.</p>

    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> The development of modern marine railway technology in the early 19th century dramatically changed the nature of shipbuilding and repair. It became possible for smaller shipyards with fewer financial resource to compete with larger ones that could afford to build expensive dry docks, like Dry Dock #1 in Charlestown Navy Yard. Constructing a marine railway cost about one-tenth of constructing a basin dry dock. Moreover, a marine railway was simpler and cheaper to operate. A marine railway’s principal advantages: 1) a vessel could be hauled quickly; 2) the railway track could be fitted to the natural slope of the shore; 3) a vessel could be transferred to and from the shore with relative ease; 4) if the vessel was a little longer than the cradle, it didn’t matter; 5) it was easy for workers to access and work on the vessel.</p>

      <p> The two-track marine railway visible from the Harborwalk on the right had a 250-foot-long cradle. The marine railway on the left had one that was 135 feet long. Almost half of the longer cradle was recovered during site work in 2017 and 105 feet of the 135-foot cradle. However all the remains were badly deteriorated.  </p>

      <p>Both marine railways visible at the site underwent several reconditionings in their 60 to 90 years of service. They were among the longest-working marine railways in the country.  The typical “life-span” of a railway was 25 years. </p>

      <a href='#'>What happened after Atlantic Works bought East Boston Dry Dock Company?

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Atlantic Works was founded in 1853 by machinists from Otis Tufts’ machine shop on Summer Street, where Clippership Wharf now stands. They built boilers and marine engines for steamships. After Atlantic Works acquired East Boston Dry Dock Company, it became the largest private ship repair facility in Boston. In 1922 it merged with the Bertelson & Peterson Company and added a large steel floating dry dock to the facility. In 1928, Atlantic Works was purchased by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, who had already purchased Simpson Dry Dock along Marginal Street a few years earlier. Bethlehem sold this shipyard about 1950 but continued to own the former Simpson yard until 1982.</p>
