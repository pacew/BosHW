  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p><strong>The Friends of the Boston Harborwalk</strong> is a
    group of volunteers, affiliated with Boston Harbor Now,
    dedicated to enhancing enjoyment of Boston's 43-mile
    Harborwalk. The Friends meet monthly to plan and coordinate our
    three main priorities. </p>
  <p>1. Host monthly two-hour long tours connected to the
    Harborwalk or Boston Harbor;</p>
  <p>2. Facilitate waterfront clean-up days to ensure that the
    full length of the Harborwalk is clean, safe, and inviting;</p>
  <p>3. Create engaging interpretive signs to help people learn
    about and enjoy the rich stories connected to Boston's
    waterfront.</p>
