      <h2>Local Industries</h2>
      <p>
	Many businesses operated on this site, including a steam
	sawmill, a blacksmith and tin shop, several lumber yards and
	coal companies, and a carriage factory. They contributed to a
	thriving corridor of shipbuilding and related industries on
	this waterfront, which lasted into the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
	These industrial uses date to the earliest days of East Boston
	development when the East Boston Timber Company was
	established in 1834 with an eye to encouraging
	shipbuilding. Timber was shipped from upstate New York, via
	the Erie Canal, and stored under water at a timber dock built
	here. The company went bankrupt six years later, but the large
	supply of inexpensive timber left behind did spur local
	shipbuilding. East Boston's first shipbuilder, Samuel Hall,
	purchased a portion of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
	In later years, other lumber companies were among the
	businesses that occupied this site, including George McQuesten
	& Company. McQuesten dealt primarily in southern hard
	pine&ndash;used extensively in local construction &ndash;and
	likely contributed to a cluster of home building businesses
	across the street.

	  West Virginia coal was unloaded at the Burton-Furber Coal
	  Company, which operated here into the mid 20th century. The
	  coal fueled sea-going vessels, East Bostonâ€™s North and South
	  ferries, and institutions such as MIT.

	  "[Before 1833], oyster-beds lined its shores; now, millions
	  in value, comprising more than half the commerce of Boston,
	  unload at its spacious wharves."

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.
