	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

      <p>
	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

	In 2017:
      </p>

      <p>200,000+ containers were offloaded from container ships at
      Conley Container Terminal, South Boston</p>


      <p>153 cruise ships carried 388,222 passengers from Black Falcon
      Cruise Terminal, South Boston</p>

      <p>49,554 vehicles came on car carriers to the Autoport in
      Charlestown</p>


      <p>28 LNG tanker deliveries brought 66.5 cubic feet of liquefied
      natural gas (LNG) to Everett Marine Terminal; enough to heat
      840,000 homes for a year</p>


      <p>92,759 metric tons of dry cement was brought in on bulk
      carriers, enough to fill more than 31,000 concrete mixer trucks,
      which combine cement with water and sand or gravel. </p>

      <p>80% of all cargo coming into Boston Harbor was petro products
      brought in on barges and fuel vessels, including all the jet
      fuel for Logan Airport. Most of the fuel depots are along
      Chelsea River.</p>

      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Boston's eight Harbor Pilots guide about 900 ships a year
	into the port. By law, any vessel over 350 gross tons that
	seeks to enter a commercial harbor must have a pilot on
	board. Large vessels usually anchor about 10 miles off shore
	and request harbor pilot assistance. Once the pilot boat comes
	alongside the ship, the pilot transfers onto the ship by
	climbing up a rope ladder dangling off its side. A Harbor
	Pilot's job can be treacherous and unpredictable, but it is
	well paid. NPR reported in 2012 that nationwide harbor pilots
	earn an average salary of $400,000/year. Boston Harbor Pilots
	operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year from
	their office in the East Boston Shipyard.

      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> The practice of employing local navigation experts as harbor
	pilots dates back to Ancient Greece and Roman times. It was a
	long-standing practice in Europe in the centuries that
	followed. Information about harbor pilots during the Colonial
	Era is sparse. It appears to have been informal with ship
	owners tapping into local men known for their knowledge of the
	harbor. Once Boston Light was built in 1716, the keeper the
	light served as the principal pilot for the harbor. The Boston
	Harbor Pilot Association, who now handle all harbor pilot
	duties, was founded in 1783.

	<span class='smaller'>[expand]</span>
      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Built in Essex, MA in 1925, the Roseway is easily recognized
	by her dark red sails. Though the schooner was used
	occasionally to fish, Roseway was specifically built to race
	in the annual competitions against the Canadian fishing
	fleet. It was on this basis that the schooner was designated a
	National Historic Landmark in 1997.</p>

      <p>In 1941, the Boston Pilots Association bought the schooner to
	serve as a pilot boat for Boston Harbor. She filled that role
	throughout World War II and up until 1973. After that, Roseway
	had several owners until in 2002, she was donated to World
	Ocean School. After a two-year restoration, she began her life
	at the heart of the non-profit educational organization
	empowering teens. Roseway spends her summers based in Boston
	and winters in St. Croix. And anyone who wants to experience
	the schooner's racing prowess, can sail with her crew during
	the yearly Labor Day Gloucester Schooner Race.</p>

      </a>
    </h2>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p> Large vessels cannot maneuver in small spaces, like Boston's
	inner harbor. Tug boats are an essential feature of the
	harbor, available 24 hours a day to assist commercial ships
	within the harbor and help them dock. Boston Towing and
	Transportation is the largest tug boat company in Boston. It
	employs 33 crew members, 9 of them USCG-certified "masters of
	towing vessels." Two or three tug boats meet container ships
	in the outer harbor and travel alongside to Conley Container
	Terminal. For vessels coming to dock along the Mystic or
	Chelsea rivers, tugs join them in the inner harbor just off
	Fish Pier.
