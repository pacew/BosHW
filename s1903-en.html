      <h1>EXPLORING THE LIVING SHORELINE</h1>
      <p>
	Much of Boston's shoreline between high and low tide&mdash;the
	intertidal zone&mdash;was lost during the 19th century, when the
	city was the second largest port in the country. Sea trade,
	ship building, and related industries dominated and changed
	the waterfront to fit their needs. Living shorelines recreate
	the intertidal zone. This one is the first such project along
	Boston's Harborwalk and an alternative solution to shorelines
	in urban areas.
      </p>

      <p>
	The project design transformed approximately 24,000 square
	feet into the new, diverse wetland community you see in front
	of you. Portions of the shoreline were terraced to create flat
	areas at different elevations. Each terrace attracts specific
	plants, depending on how much time they need to spend under
	water as the tide flows in and out. A greater diversity of
	plants lives on the upper terraces.
      </p>

      <p>
	Below the marsh grasses, various animals thrive in the tide
	pools.  Common periwinkles, blue mussels, sea urchins,
	northern moon snails, and sea stars feed and take shelter in
	the vegetation. Sea birds, in turn, feast on the animals
	living in the grasses. Together they create a vibrant
	ecosystem.

	  The recreated salt marsh allows you to experience the
	  original New England coastline ecology in an urban area and
	  witness how our shoreline grows and recedes twice a day with
	  the rise and fall of the tide.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

	A salt marsh is a coastal ecosystem that lies between open salt water and land and is regularly flooded by tides. Salt marsh can stretch hundreds of acres along the shore and is a highly productive habitat where large amounts of organic matter is deposited and decomposes, creating a food chain that sustains birds and animals.

	Salt marsh plays a vital role in the aquatic food web,
	delivering nutrients to coastal waters. It provides refuge and
	is a food source for animals and birds. Also, many marine fish
	use the salt marsh as their "nursery" for newly hatched fish
	before they swim into open water. Finally, people have
	somewhat belatedly realized that acres of salt marsh serve as
	important protection from ocean storms.  Recognizing the
	extraordinary importance of salt marsh in our ecosystem, many
	organizations are working very hard to protect all remaining
	salt marsh from development.

	This is a vertical datum point used by developers and
	surveyors working in Boston. Established before the North
	American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD'88)*, which is used
	nation-wide, it gives an agreed-upon baseline for below- and
	above-ground projects in the city.
