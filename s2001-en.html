      <h1>Prestigious Wharf and Building</h1>
      <p>
	As global sea trade opportunities expanded, a group of Boston
	investors proposed a new deep-water wharf, along with new
	streets and buildings. They hired architect Charles Bulfinch
	to draw the plans, creating Broad and India
	streets. Construction of India Wharf began in 1804, and soon
	after, Bulfinch designed the India Building that stood here
	for more than 150 years.
      </p>
      <p>
	To have one's office at India Wharf was considered highly
	prestigious. Boston's leading ship owners had their "counting
	houses" on the second floor, while the ground floor was filled
	with sea trade-related retail businesses. The building also
	housed the consulates of Belgium, Russia, Norway, and Sweden.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the 1860s, shipping to this area of Boston Harbor began to
	decline, largely because there was no rail access to move
	goods inland. A new sea wall was constructed in 1869 and fill
	added between the wharves, shortening Central and India
	wharves. A century later, the last section of the once
	prominent Bulfinch building was torn down.

	  In 1886, a group of prominent Boston men established the
	  India Wharf Rats club on the third floor of what remained of
	  the India Building. They met twice a month for dinner and
	  poker. When the building came down in 1962, the club moved
	  to the Custom House Block on Long Wharf.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

      <p>
	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.
