      <h1>Harbor Towers Rise</h1>
      <p>
	In 1971, Harbor Towers were the first major residential
	buildings constructed along Boston's waterfront. The project
	was part of the city's effort to turn things around on its
	dilapidated wharves. Boston had been in decline like many
	U.S. cities, its population dropping. The revitalization plan
	also included Columbus Park, the New England Aquarium, and
	renewal of Quincy Market.
      </p>
      <p>
	Charles Bulfinch designed the building that stood upon India
	Wharf for 155 years. Similarly, highly regarded Henry Cobb of
	I. M. Pei & Partners was chosen as the architect for Harbor
	Towers. Cobb's design came midst the city's bold&mdash;though
	short-lived&mdash;experiment with concrete modernism or Brutalist
	architecture. Some saw concrete as compatible with the city's
	granite warehouses.
      </p>
      <p>
	Boston's Mayor White touted Harbor Towers as luxury living on
	the harbor, hoping to lure people to the city. However, delays
	in street and sidewalk connections and the setting between a
	then-polluted harbor and elevated highway forced lower rents.
	Today, thanks to two massive investments of public funds&mdash;the
	Big Dig and the successful harbor clean-up&mdash;the towers are
	among the city's most desirable residences.

	  Once at the heart of Boston's sea trade, in the late 1960s,
	  India Wharf&mdash;to the left of Central Wharf&mdash;served as a parking
	  lot, wedged between the six-lane Central Artery and a filthy
	  harbor.

	  Early newspaper ads, like this one from the Boston Globe on
	  June 23, 1971, encouraged people to "Be far-sighted," to
	  "Return to the Sea," and drew on legends Paul Revere and
	  Herman Melville.

	<p>
	  A plan proposed by the city in the early 1960s called for
	  four shorter towers on India Wharf. This changed to three
	  40-story towers and ultimately two. Architect Henry Cobb
	  lamented the change, explaining that two towers "don't have
	  the same compositional interest" as his pinwheel plan. But
	  it did create more open space.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.
