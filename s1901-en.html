      <h1>New Life as Floating Barracks</h1>
      <p>
	For 37 years, U.S.R.S. <em>Wabash</em> lay anchored just off here, the
	longest serving receiving ship in the U.S. Navy. From the
	moment in 1862 when the Navy launched its first iron-hulled
	battleship, the days of wooden ships in combat were
	numbered. In the decades that followed, several decommissioned
	wooden vessels found new uses at Navy yards as receiving
	ships. U.S.R.S. <em>Wabash</em>, U.S.R.S. <em>Constitution</em>, and the first
	vessel ever built here at the Charlestown Navy Yard,
	U.S.R.S. <em>Independence</em>, were among them.
      </p>
      <p>
	These receiving ships often housed several hundred sailors. To
	increase usable space, the upper rigging was removed from the
	masts and a roof covered the top deck&mdash;transforming the once
	stately vessels. They served many purposes: recruiting
	stations, transit barracks, and hospitals, as well as training
	centers for both recruits and teenage boys, who began their
	apprenticeships on board.
      </p>
      <p>
	After World War I, the Navy phased out receiving ships,
	replacing them with on-shore barracks.

	  Powered both by sails and steam, U.S.S.
	  <em>Wabash</em> saw duty in Central America and
	  the Mediterranean before participating in
	  the blockade of southern ports during the
	  American Civil War. Drawing by Clary Ray,
	  c. 1900, shows the ship under steam and sail.

	  United States receiving ships&mdash;designated as
	  U.S.R.S.&mdash;provided excellent training opportunities for newly
	  recruited sailors who could master shipboard skills before
	  heading to sea. In this 1883 photo, the commanding officer
	  wears a sword.

	  U.S.S. <em>Constitution</em> served as a floating barracks at the
	  Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1881&ndash;1896. In this 1906 postcard
	  photo of her in the Charlestown Navy Yard, she is still
	  outfitted as a receiving ship. A year later the house was
	  removed as part of the ship's initial restoration.

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

      <a href='#'>How did Colonial laws help create today's Harborwalk?

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p>
	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.
