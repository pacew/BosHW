      <h1>BOSTON'S WOODEN SHIPBUILDING CENTER</h1>
      <p>
	In 1839, just six years after East Boston began to be
	developed as a neighborhood, Samuel Hall established a
	shipyard on this site. It grew to include dry docks that used
	the most advanced steam-powered technology and marine
	railways, still visible today along the waterfront.  Among the
	110 vessels Hall built here was Boston's first clipper
	ship&ndash;<em>Surprise</em>. Her launch in 1850 was
	accompanied by church bells ringing. The names of some of
	Hall's other vessels are engraved on the granite paving.
      </p>
      <p>
	Hall's shipyard was one of several along the stretch of the
	waterfront from here north to the Meridian Street Bridge,
	where Hall, Donald McKay, Robert Jackson, Paul Curtis, and
	others built world-famous ships. Spurred by the California
	Gold Rush and a demand for faster ships, they launched more
	than 200 vessels in 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
	Together with the Charlestown Navy Yard across the harbor and
	shipyards in South Boston, East Boston shipbuilders made the
	city one of the premier ship building centers in the country
	during the mid 1800s.

	  Sailing cards like this one
	  for <em>Fearless</em> were widely used to advertise
	  ship departures. <em>Fearless</em>, also designed by
	  Pook, was built here by George Sampson,
	  who leased part of Hall's shipyard starting
	  in 1852.

	  Kong with her mother and six siblings.  They joined Warren
	  Delano, who was very active in the China trade for many
	  years.  FDR admired his family's maritime history and
	  owned two paintings and this model of the famous clipper
	  ship, as well as the ship's log of his mother's trip.</p>

	Community activists. Colonial law. Political will. New state
	regulations. The combination created the 43-mile Boston
	Harborwalk&ndash;a public path, stretching from Logan Airport
	through seven neighborhoods to the Neponset River. In 1978,
	the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-office-of-coastal-zone-management'>Massachusetts
	Office of Coastal Zone Management</a> (CZM) sought to improve
	public access to the waterfront. They succeeded by integrating
	early Colonial laws into new state regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the decades that followed, community activists, city and
	state government, and developers of shoreline projects have
	worked together to ensure the Harborwalk is always constructed
	along the waterfront. Some sites also provide public
	amenities&ndash;bathrooms, meeting places, kayak launches,
	etc. The result is a fabulous path welcoming residents and
	visitors to our vibrant clean harbor.

	Early Colonial laws established public right of access along
	tidelands to protect citizens' rights to fish, hunt, and
	navigate at sea and along the shorefront. These laws go back
	even further: They stem from Roman law, which was incorporated
	into English law and brought over to Massachusetts by English
	settlers. Then, in the 1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony passed
	laws permitting private docks in the intertidal area (between
	low and high tide) as long as public access was
	retained. Almost all of Boston's waterfront is filled land
	that was once the intertidal area. This, together with the
	centuries-old legal right of access, served as the
	underpinnings for the 1978 CZM regulations.

	What's a clipper ship? <span class='smaller'>[expand]</span></a>

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p>
	Swift, with long sharp bows and names like <em>Chariot of Fame</em>,
	<em>Empress of the Seas</em>, 
	<em>Flying Fish</em>,
	<em>Coeur de Lion</em>, 
	<em>Staghound</em>, and <em>Lightning</em>, "in every way
	clipper ships ranked among the most handsome vessels ever put
	afloat." [1] Three-masted and square-rigged, clipper ships
	were unusual merchant vessels because they were designed for
	great speed rather than capacity. They sailed across oceans on
	trade routes where speed translated into significant
	profit. In the China trade, an exceptionally fast clipper ship
	could beat the competition, bringing back tea from Guangzhou
	(formerly Canton to westerners) and fetching the highest
	prices. The California Gold Rush (1848&ndash;1855) and the
	Australian gold rushes of the 1850s spurred additional clipper
	ship construction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Clipper ships set records: <em>Flying Cloud</em>&ndash;New
	York to San Francisco in 89 days, 8 hours; <em>Sovereign of
	the Seas</em> 22 knots;
	<em>Champion of the Seas</em> 465 nautical miles in one
	day. No steamship of their day could beat them. And no
	square-rigged ship has ever broken <em>Flying Cloud's</em>
	record. Finally in the 1870s, with improved marine engines and
	boilers, steam-powered vessels broke clipper ship speed
	records. [2] And so like the gold rushes themselves, the era
	of clipper ships was short-lived. Because the vessels carried
	such immense sail area, they required large crews, which added
	to operating costs. And the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869
	favored steamships. For many, clipper ships represent the
	zenith of the age of sail.  Their memory endures in books,
	paintings, and models.

    <div class='tail-body' style='display:none'>
      <p>George Lewis was a self-emancipated black man who worked as a carpenter in Samuel Hall's shipyard from 1847 to 1850. Lewis escaped from slavery in Virginia in 1846 and arrived in Boston in July of 1847 after a harrowing, 10-month journey north. He was introduced to Samuel Hall by Austin Bearse, a sea captain and abolitionist, and Hall hired him on the spot. As Bearse later recounted, Hall's decision to hire Lewis was controversial: "Some of his ship carpenters left on account of it, but Mr. Hall kept George."[1] Samuel Hall left no account of his thinking in hiring Lewis, but his friendship with Bearse and a longstanding neighborhood rumor that Hall's house on Webster Street was a stop on the Underground Railroad suggest that he may have been sympathetic to the anti-slavery cause. Most of Lewis' fellow shipyard workers were white New Englanders and Maritime Canadians. They were trained in an apprentice system that was largely closed to outsiders,[2] which makes Lewis' success all the more extraordinary &ndash; in 1848 Lewis described himself as a "carpenter" in the City Directory, but by 1850, he was listed as a "shipwright", one of the most skilled and highly paid jobs in the shipyard.[3][4] Lewis very likely helped build Massachusetts' first clipper ship, the Surprise, launched from Hall's shipyard in 1850. </p>

      <p>George Lewis quickly built a life in Boston. In 1849, he bought a house near Hall's shipyard at the corner of Havre and Porter Streets.[5] He became an early leader in Boston's Twelfth Baptist Church, a black congregation that was known as the "Fugitive Slave Church" at the time for its commitment to abolitionism and reputation for welcoming and assisting former slaves.[6] Lewis served as one of three trustees who secured land and financing to build the congregation's first church on Beacon Hill.[7] In 1850, the US Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, a law that required local authorities to return escaped slaves to their owners, even in free states like Massachusetts. Fearing for his safety, George Lewis fled to Canada with his family.[8] But it seems that he continued to think of Boston as home, and he moved back to East Boston with his family at the end of the Civil War, buying a new house on Chelsea Street in Day Square.[9]</p>

      <a href='#'>Are there any physical reminders of East

	Although none of the grand sailing ships built in East Boston
	survive today, the craftsmanship of the carpenters,
	woodcarvers, and other workers who built these ships can still
	be seen in many of East Boston's 19th century houses. Most
	shipyard workers were independent contractors, frequently
	moving from shipyard to shipyard to find work. When
	shipbuilding work was scarce, they occasionally found jobs
	building houses in the neighborhood. And when advances in
	railroads and steamships led to the collapse of East Boston's
	wooden shipbuilding industry after the Civil War, many former
	shipyard workers transitioned to full time jobs in housing
	construction.
      </p>
      <p>
	Samuel Manson and Seth Peterson were ship joiners, craftsmen
	who made cabinetry and other interior finishes for ships. They
	moved to East Boston in 1841 and set up shop across the street
	from Samuel Hall's shipyard. But by the 1870s, Manson and
	Peterson were exclusively making fireplace mantels, trim, and
	doors for East Boston houses. The influence of shipyard
	workers on East Boston's architecture continued long after
	most of the neighborhood's shipyards had closed. In 1976, East
	Boston resident Janet Graves recalled how her grandfather, a
	former shipyard worker, oversaw the construction of her family
	home at 388 Meridian Street in the 1890s: "My grandfather,
	having been a shipbuilder, knew how things should be built and
	he watched every nail." Even today, East Boston's shipbuilding
	legacy lives on in the handsome trim and finely carved details
	that adorn the facades of many of the neighborhood's Victorian
	houses.

      <p>
	The 19th century Boston directories, which list workers by
	occupation, provide a ready inventory of what skills were most
	utilized in East Boston shipyards. Work in the yard,
	generally, was divided into three main categories:
	shipwright/ship carpenter, caulker, or joiner.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Some workers identified themselves as ship carpenters, a
	skilled trade, but not as skilled as that of the shipwright,
	who would often work in the mould loft, converting drawings
	into frames, and making sure those frames were set
	properly. Caulkers used special mallets and chisels to force
	oakum into the seams of the hull and deck. When these seams
	were coated with tar, they became waterproof. Ship joiners
	built cabins, stairs, doors, and furniture.
      </p>

      <p>
	Wooden vessels required thousands of holes to be bored, both
	for iron rods to hold the knees&ndash;crooked timbers acting
	as braces&ndash;to the frame, and for treenails (pronounced
	"trunnels") to fasten planking to the exterior. Often,
	carpenters were called upon to do this. They might also be
	required to adze the exterior joints of the hull, or to act in
	the capacity of sawyers, hewing planks for logs. This was very
	heavy labor and the fact that the carpenter sometimes did work
	more often associated with workers of the lowest skill level
	in the yards, suggests, again, that the ship carpenter ranked
	below a shipwright in skill level. Nevertheless, the ship
	carpenter was a skilled craftsman who had learned his trade
	through a multi-year apprenticeship.
      </p>
      <p>
	The caulker, a man of critical importance in the construction
	of a sailing vessel, often worked on his back under the belly
	of the vessel. Hammer noise was an occupational hazard in
	getting oakum into a seam, and men who did this work often
	became deaf. Their work was perhaps the most repetitive in the
	yard and required a good deal of physical strength. But for
	those who had the aptitude, it was one of the most prized and
	highly paid jobs in the yard, no matter how occupationally
	risky. In order for a ship to remain tight, caulkers had to do
	their jobs well. Lives depended upon them. But it was
	dreadful, tedious work.
      </p>
      <p>
	Caulkers and joiners pursued specialized finishing trades, and
	were apt to move from one yard to another looking for ships
	near the finishing stage. A ship carpenter, or shipwright,
	tended to remain with a single yard while a ship was under
	construction. Once the work was done, however, he too would
	move along.
